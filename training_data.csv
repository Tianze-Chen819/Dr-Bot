N1,"My friend's mom needs a liver One of my best friend's mom is uninsured and has been diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver. She's a sweet lady who doesn't drink or do drugs or anything like that. She's just a simple mother, wife, and homemaker.She's not expected to make it through the end of the year if she doesn't get a transplant, but being uninsured is a big obstacle.Does anybody have any information on a situation like this? Are there any organizations, charities, medical groups, or other institutions out there that can help work around the insurance issue? Or any insurance companies willing to take on a patient in immediate need of a liver transplant?I realize these questions might be kind of dumb, but I have absolutely zero experience with anything like this, and I want to help gather information for my friend. Any leads, info, and/or resources would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.","Its not just a work around the insurance, she will need lifelong expensive meds after surgery as well. Why does she not have insurance?"

N3,"Bump on toddlerâ€™s neck for months 3M, average height and weight, white, no medications or known medical issues.I noticed in at least early August that my 3.5 year old son has a bump on his neck where I believe a lymph node is located. Itâ€™s been a few months now and it has not changed, if anything it has gotten slightly bigger. It is not present on the other side and is not tender to touch. Prior to noticing the bump, he was not recently sick that I can remember. I also canâ€™t remember if the bump was there before August but I think itâ€™s possible.I donâ€™t know how to attach a photo to this post, Iâ€™m going to try but I am probably doing it wrong lolhttps://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52456491219_4e1d27f88c_h.jpgI emailed a photo and description to his pediatrician and she said to just watch it. Is it safe to just watch or should I push for him to be seen? Bloodwork? Am I being paranoid?","That looks bigger than a lymph node. Also while there are lymph nodes back there, they are few and it is not common for them to get inflamed, unless he had an infection in the nearby scalp and ear at some point. If it is a lymph node, it is abnormally enlarged and could be related to an unusual infection. Other things are possible. I would get an ultrasound of it given that you're saying it has been there for several months and may even have gotten larger."
N5,"F24 250 heart question I have health anxiety and just a bunch of anxiety in general. When I have panic attacks I feel like Iâ€™m dying and like my heart is beating weird. Blood pressure is normal. Sometimes high when Iâ€™m nervous but once calm it is where it should be. Iâ€™ve had a stress test, probably 10 ekgs (sometimes while having symptoms), 2 week long monitors in the last year, an echo, blood work. All is normal. Is it pretty safe to say my heart is okay? If I had a problem would it have shown up by now? Ps: I know I need to lose weight and Iâ€™m working on it. I had the symptoms I have now when I was a high school athlete and much smaller.",You've had a comprehensive work-up so you can feel assured that there's nothing actionable that need to happen with your heart.

N7,"Tinnitus from Hair Touching Eardrum? Pictures included. 39M.  260 lbs.  Eastern-European ancestry.  I've had tinnitus in my left ear for a couple of years now. I just woke up one night with it, and it has never gone way. I've also sometimes noticed clicking in that ear when I swallow.My GP has looked inside, said it looked fine, and suggested Eustachian tube disfunction. He recommended nasal steroid sprays, which I tried to no real effect. The tinnitus can be modulated by moving my jaw, and I don't have any history of listening to loud noises or hearing loss. I've also talked to my dentist for TMJ, got a night guard and such, and none of it has helped.Out of curiosity, the other day I bought a cheap $20 ear cleaning kit on amazon that comes with a camera you can stick in your ear. I figured I would try to take a look at what is inside to see if I could see anything.So, here is my right eardrum. The one that I don't really have problems with.https://i.imgur.com/BmJOlC7And here is my left eardrum, which has the hissing. I notice two separate hairs which look like they are touching it.https://imgur.com/a/bRKoU84Has this been the cause of my suffering the past few years? I wonder if there is an easy way to get them out.","The hair is not causing your tinnitus. Would consider getting a hearing test as hearing loss can cause tinnitus."
N8,"Desperately need help with my sleep- I am so tired I can barely function 25 M; 5 ft. 7 in; 171 lbs (overweight)I live in CA and am on PST. My natural body rhythm for many, many years has been for me to go to bed between Midnight and 1 PM. It then takes me about an hour to fall asleep, and then I wake up at 10 AM or so. When I am able to adhere to this schedule, I feel well-rested most of the time.6 weeks ago I started a stressful job. Because of my commute, I now have to wake up at 6:45AM. For the past 6 weeks, I have been doing my best on the weekdays to go to sleep at 11:00 PM sharp. However, whenever I wake up, I feel like a zombie and my mind is absolutely shot. I am so tired at the moment that I don't even feel confident that I am proofreading this post accurately. My job requires me to use my brain, so this is very stressful for me.My question is, how can I push back my body's internal clock and wake up at 6:45 AM?Thank you so much for your time and help.","Practice, practice, practice. Before working in medicine I used sleep most days until 9-11am, for the past 5+ years I've been getting up between 5-7am and now I can't sleep past 7:30 even on my days off. Make sure you're in bed by 9pm so you can get at least 7 hours of sleep and adhere to strict sleep hygiene guidelines."
N9,"Doctors please help my little sister, she can't walk, I'm afraid she's going to die 8F, 78lbs, no medication. She was in the hospital for a long time but they discharged her. She is still in pain, please help. I attached the notes of her discharge.The patient is an 8-year-old white female with five weeks of fever, rash, arthralgias. Last month, the patient noted foot pain involving both left and right feet, as well as a blotchy pink rash on the leg that proceeded to spread to the trunk and then arms and then face during that week. The patient had low-grade fevers with temps to a max of 101. This has progressed to the week prior to admission higher fevers with T-max of 103.5. The patient has endorsed muscle pain, particularly in the right leg and arm, and PMD had seen the patient this week noted right knee and right index finger swelling. There is no noted weight change over this time period. No noted diarrhea or swollen nodes. The rash the patient described the week prior had an acute abrupt onset and 5-10 minutes later would dissipate.Rheumatology was consulted on the patient from admission. Lab studies were sent to rule-out an infectious etiology for rash. Strep culture was negative. EKG was also performed to rule-out a prolonged PR interval. EKG was within normal limits. A DNase B antibody was 547 and an ASO titer was 300. While results were elevated, the patient did no meet clinical criteria for rheumatic fever and diagnosis that was most likely entertained was systemic JIA. Further lab work included an ANA which was negative, rheumatoid factor which was negative, a CRP on admission was 8.6 mg/dL with an ESR about 80. CK and aldolase were within normal limits. Ferritin was elevated at 663. LDH was within normal limits. CBC was reassuring with normal white counts, hemoglobin and platelets; findings nonsuggestive of leukemia. Hepatic panel within normal limits. A chest x-ray was done to rule-out mediastinal mass, and that was negative. From an infectious standpoint, Parvo, CMV, EBV were all negative. Clinically the patient was noted to have a salmon-colored transient rash that would come and go throughout the hospitalization lasting a matter of minutes. No definite arthritis on examination. Oncology was consulted given the history of arthritis and fevers. It was felt in the setting of normal cell lines in evaluating a smear, which revealed no blasts, no indication of hepatomegaly or splenomegaly and uric acid and LDH within normal limits and x-ray that was normal, they felt that further oncologic evaluation was not indicated and a bone marrow was not indicated at that time. Cardiology was also officially consulted because the patient had a 2/6 ejection murmur on the exam. Cardiology felt the murmur was a flow murmur and evaluated the EKG, which they read aswithin normal limits, and decided an echo was not indicated to rule-out valvular disease in the setting of the rash and arthritis in an attempt to workup acute rheumatic fever.","Internal medicine doc here but in my differential is Adult Onset Stills Disease which can still present in children and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. The salmon colored rash lasting a few minutes is textbook for Adult Onset Stills Disease. I'm assuming she had blood cultures done at one or multiple points during her admission. Did she have a procalcitonin tested? Did she receive any antibiotics? Any steroids like solumedrol, prednisone etc? Does she still have joint pain? Does this rash show up only during febrile episodes? Any auto immune conditions in the family like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, hashimotos?"

I was diagnosed with (diabetic) neuropathy  around 15 years of age. The symptoms were managable. I had tingling and burning sensation in my extremities, pain, reduced ability to feel temperature changes... Etc. I didn't much pay attention to it, untill two years ago. It started literally as a painful spot in my upper arm. Below the sholder, above the elbove. The apot wasnt bigger than the size of a avarage coin. It would hurt for few seconds, once in a day, which was weird for me, because it was localised, unlick neuropathy, where i couldnt locate just one painful spot.It started from a spot and today i cant lift my arm anymore. The pain has spread throught my arm and should. My whole arm hurts, even my fingers. I cant lift arm, up or on the side, i can't put it behind my back anymore. I can barely wipe my glutes, etc, i have developed insomnia, because i cant sleep from the pain. The pain is not always there, but it mostly is. When i am not moving much, it hurts but not that bad. When i try to, for example take off my hoodie, which involes mu right arm to lift, the pain shoots, like someone stabed me. Why am I writing is to ask, if it is possible that this kind of pain is the result of neuropathy. I can use my arm normaly, if i am not raising it, or movimg it. Like if its to my body, i cam write normally, use my phone, tye my shoes, cook etc, but i have to lift it, than the pain is unmanageable and o immediately have to put back, beside my torso.","Hi!Answer to your question, yes, those symptoms can be caused by diabetic peripheral neuropathy, you need your blood glucose controlled better, you can take pregabalin to control the pain thatâ€™s due to diabetes.."

N13,"I don't know if this is the right place but please help: Grew up in abuse and neglect, never learnt dental care. Need dental care, struggling financially. Any advice? (Australia) I 25f grew up in an ubuse/neglect situation. I didn't honestly know that dental care was even a real thing until my late teens. My parents nor siblings didn't do it, siblings and myself were never taught. By the time I started the damage was already done and getting worse. My front right tooth is decaying and I have a gap where my second to front left tooth should be, where there was a baby tooth that fell out when I was about 21. I've obviously never had nice teeth and I've always been extremely self-conscious about it.What are my options going forward? Can anyone explain the process of going to a dentist? Do you tell them what you want to do before the appointment? Do they have set prices? Im in a tough spot financially so I'm scared of getting a higher than anticipated bill. I'm confused by the whole process. I've only been to a dentist once as an adult when I had sepsis from an infected wisdom tooth thus don't really remember the experience. Please help. Any advice is welcome.","I agree with some of the advice that others have given already! Just want to add that itâ€™s extremely common for people to be nervous about going to the dentist, especially if you havenâ€™t been often. Dentists know this, and should be supportive throughout. You can let them know that you are nervous or that you havenâ€™t seen a dentist recently. You should be able to phone local dentists and discuss with reception what the pricing is for a regular check up. At your first appointment they can explain what other treatments they recommend and how much they cost. Its hard to find free dental care in Aus, but clinics will have different prices, and they can give you that information before your appointment. I think itâ€™s great that you want to see a dentist and have your teeth looked at.

N14,"Ran head first into a metal bar 30F, 5â€™8â€ù, no medical issues.I was at the playground with my toddler about an hour ago and needed to chase after him. I ran directly into a metal bar. I was looking at the ground so I hit the very top of my head. My husband was about 30ft away and said it was loud. I didnâ€™t lose consciousness or anything, just had to sit for awhile and compose myself. Now I have a big bump and a headacheâ€” not the worst headache of my life tho. I feel a bit â€œoffâ€ù and Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s just my anxiety or what. Wondering if I should see a doctor or wait it out?

N16,"How bad is this PET Scan result? Testicular cancer patient. Explanation of scan would be helpful. 27M - 6â€™7â€ù, 225lbs. White. Generally healthy before cancer. Bad at Reddit format. Diagnosed with stage 3 seminoma in July of this year. Had surgery and did four rounds of etoposide and cisplatin as chemotherapy. Seminoma did not present physically, only presentation was severe back pain. I have had other back issues so I lived in pain for close to a year. Went to oncologist per ER referral and Ultrasound confirmed seminoma. I got a pet scan today after completing chemo last week. I was very optimistic and my doctor has given me no reason to suspect there would be any problems. He said 95% sure chemo would take care of it. I am going to paste the results that were posted on my patient portal below. I am a big boy and a logical thinker please Donâ€™t sugar coat theses results, translate and explain if possible. I was expecting good news but I can tell this is not. I can have peace if I understand it. My follow up with my oncologist is not until next week and Iâ€™m very anxious and want to understand. Begin Results:â€”â€”â€”â€”-:Impression:1.Hypermetabolic left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam. Calcification present. Metastatic disease cannot be excluded as this node was not hypermetabolic on prior exam. 2. Much improvement in retroperitoneal adenopathy in both size of lymph nodes, extent of lymph nodes, and decrease in hypermetabolic activity compared to prior exam. 3. No other areas of metastatic disease suspected.Findings:1. There is a calcified left hilar lymph node unchanged in size from prior exam probably about 1 cm in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV today of 5.3 and previously not hypermetabolic maximum activity 2.0.2.  The previously noted large intra-aortocaval lymph node has markedly decreased in size and on today's exam is subcentimeter in short axis measurements with a maximum SUV of 6.8 whereas previously maximum SUV was 16.6.3.  More inferiorly in the intra-aortocaval region of the retroperitoneum where multiple previous adjacent hypermetabolic lymph nodes were seen with a maximum SUV of 20.8, on today's exam 1 lymph node measuring roughly 8 mm in short axis measurement is present maximum SUV 6.8.","A PET scan obtained right after finishing chemotherapy increases the likelihood of false positive results. It takes time for your body to clean up after chemotherapy or surgery or radiation. The residual activity that a PET scan captures in the active areas can take a few months to calm down. The presence of hypermetabolic areas is not unexpected when it was only a week since your last treatment. The fact that the areas of activity noted on prior scans are now smaller is good news. It strongly suggests that your cancer is responding to treatment. The new spot in your chest (the hilar node) may or may not be significant. There are other things that can cause a node to light up on PET scan. The presence of calcifications in a node is usually an indication of benign causes, rather than malignant causes of hypermetabolic activity. The only way to know for sure is a biopsy, which they probably won't recommend right now. Note: I am not an oncologist. Talk to your doctor about the results and the plan for follow-up. Good luck!"

The pain sometimes shoots up to the left kidney area.I made a really stupid decision yesterday by going to the ER with no insurance. They gave me an ultrasound, physical exam, and urine test.

N19,"First T/C seizure, then first migraine less than 3 weeks later? So, on September 17 I (21F) had an unprovoked, tonic clonic seizure. The morning of, I woke up at 7am to a bad headache above my right eye that was also on the back of my head on the left side. I had some snacks thinking it might be hunger, no improvement. I later took 600mg ibuprofen, also no improvement. I was putting in an earring (which Iâ€™ve never had a problem with shots, piercings, excision biopsies, etc and i was not nervous or had locked knees or w/e) and after putting it in I immediately got dizzy with tunnel vision. Luckily, my boyfriend was there and held onto me, as I have fainted before and could tell it was coming. I went unconscious seconds after he grabbed me. This is where I know it wasnâ€™t fainting: He said my body stiffened and I was still standing while unconscious, I let out a groan, and then mainly my upper body began convulsing. He laid me down in the hallway and the convulsions calmed down. He said at that point my face was turning blue and he thought I needed CPR, so he began compressions. By the third one, I was waking up as if from a deep sleep, and tried to shove him off as if I wanted 5 more minutes. The first thing I could think was how sore I was, as if I went to the gym the day before. I hadnâ€™t opened my eyes yet or tried to speak, my hearing seemed muffled. Then I opened my eyes and was able to begin talking within a couple seconds. I had immediate, intense anxiety and was extremely exhausted, also crying for no reason? maybe fear? My headache was also much worse. This has never happened to me and as much as I wanted it to just be fainting, I know its not. Iâ€™ve fainted a handful of times in my life and itâ€™s never had any other events/symptoms like this did. I didnâ€™t know i was supposed to go to the ER, because I didnâ€™t realize it was a seizure. But I told a telehealth Dr what happened and they said it was a tonic-clonic seizure. I went to a NP at my physician office and she just wonâ€™t believe me and said i just fainted. So i feel discouraged.Yesterday, 10/6, I had my first migraine. It began an hour after waking (~10am) above my right eye near my hairline. By 5pm the whole right side of my face hurt, I had intense sound/light sensitivity, felt dazed, dizzy, lightheaded, muffled hearing, ear pressure, and had some vision changes like blurs/lights. It has also followed into today, 10/07.My parents and the NP have discouraged me of my own experiences and itâ€™s making me feel crazy for thinking this needs to be checked out. I just need a professional to hear this and hopefully give me insight. I donâ€™t want to find out itâ€™s too late if I donâ€™t do anything, but my family has always treated me as if iâ€™m faking illnesses, even though i never have and have never been dramatic in any way. please help. iâ€™m still on their insurance, so thatâ€™s why itâ€™s important.thank you.TLDR: F21 has unprovoked, first TC seizure 09/17. First vestibular migraine 10/06 into 10/07. Any relation or cause for concern? Parents wonâ€™t take me seriously. Please and thank you.","Based on the information provided I'm not sure this was actually a seizure and I wonder if this was a vaso vagal syncopal event.

Took Paracetamol and Ibuprofen during the cold, now on nothing.These blisters form sporadically on my right hand and are tingling/itchy to the touch. No pain or anything. I have no idea where they could be coming from. Iâ€™ve noticed a couple of itchy spots on my body the last two weeks which I though would be from mosquitoes but I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s it. Most spots are just itching with no visible bite marks or blisters of any kind, but I donâ€™t have 2 or 3 tiny little blister on other parts of my body.

N31,"My mom [53F] has stage 4 breast cancer and is adamant on using dangerous substances to 'treat' herself Hello,My mom was recently diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer. Thankfully she has started treatment with oral medicine and will start Xgeva injections at her next visit, but she still says that she does not trust the doctors fully. During our first visit to the doctor she told him that she wanted to treat her cancer in a more ""natural way"". Earlier today she asked me for my paypal password, which i had no problem with. I didn't really question it, but I then got emailed receipts from purchases that she had made. She used my account to buy Black Slave and Sodium Chorite (which she will use to make MMS or a ""Miracle Mineral Supplement""). The doctor had told us that her cancer was quite close to the skin and I am aware that she may have a skin lesion there, and i know she will be using Black Salve to 'cure' the skin lesion. I also searched up the ""miracle"" mineral supplement, and it is something that conspiracy theorists promote as an end all be all cure to seemingly every illness ranging from cancer and HIV to COVID-19 and the common flu. I have just contacted paypal to cancel the payments and I hope she never gets a hold of them.I have tried telling her and showing her images of how harmful these substances are to the human body but she doesn't believe me and just brushes me off and i don't know what to do.. Just now when i tried talking to her about why using these would be a bad idea, i noticed that she was reading something about MMS on her computer. I fear that as time goes by she will become more and more convinced of these alternate techniques, which could end badly. How can i convince her to stop believing these things? What can i do?","There's probably nothing you can do, no magic combination of words you can use to convince her. Getting diagnosed with Stage IV cancer is a massive psychological trauma, it breaks a lot of people. Right now she is probably in a storm of emotions, and will latch onto any hope that is offered. I imagine her doctors aren't giving her very positive and hopeful outlooks and are probably telling her that there's no treatment that they can offer to save her life. Alternatively, there are stories on the internet filled with hope about MMS and other naturopathic/homeopathic remedies.People who have just been broken by a diagnosis like this often aren't using logic to make decisions, they use emotions. If you want to use a 5 Stages of Grief Model to help you understand what's going on, she's in the bargaining stage. She sees the hope and positivity on the internet and latches onto it because of course she will.There's likely nothing you can do to change her thinking, she's not using logic to make these decisions, so logic is not going to make her stop. She just has to work through her grief until she comes to acceptance. You can try to fight it if you want, but you're not going to win. I'd suggest trying to minimize conflict and support her through this time as best you can, even though she's making emotional decisions. Do you want to remember this time as filled with fighting?"

N33,"I'm (18M) clueless, surrounded by anti-vaxxers and I need help and information about vaccines Hello. This has nothing to do with politics. I'm worried about my health and need help.I am not vaccinated against Covid-19, and I do not remember ever getting any vaccine as a child.My mother told me she had me get all the mandatory vaccines as a baby/young child.My whole family is strongly against vaccines, and not a single one of them is vaccinated against Covid. Since 2020 I've been bombarded with conflicting information and my brain is basically mush on the topic. I'm absolutely clueless.I've gotten sick a couple times over the past 2 years, and I've done many covid tests, but they were always negative. I've never caught the virus, nor has my mother.A few members of my family have gotten it, and my grandpa died from it; he was already in very bad health conditions due to old age, but everyone else is fine and have always been healthy.Every person I know who has gotten it was fine after a few days, and the symptoms were mild.Every time I hear my family talk, I hear conspiracy theorists spitting fluff, but at the same time every personal experience I've had tells me that it's not that bad.I know that the data is out there. I know science is right, I'm not against masks, and I'm not against the vaccine. I've been raised in a sub-optimal environment and it's hard to detach from it.Before, during and after the lockdowns I was (and still somewhat am) severely depressed and non caring about my health. This has and is affecting my ability to think rationally.I've been over 18 for a few months now, but I haven't yet decided to get the shot. It seems like a hassle that isn't worth it, especially considering that I have no clue where to get the vaccine, if I should get all of the other ones that my mother hasn't given me and a bunch of other stuff.My depression prevents me for doing anything that takes a bit of effort so I'm asking you to please convince me that I need to get the vaccine.I'm in Italy, and I haven't heard about covid cases and vaccines in many months now. Just writing this post put a weight on my heart. I ask you to please not judge me as you would a typical politics-based antivaxxer. I'm just confused",See your general practitioner.

I work in electrical so considered the possibility of damage from dust. History of bulimia which is currently active (would say 3-4 days are purge days). It comes down to last night, on a walk, I got excessively dizzy and weak. I kept on walking with vision in both eyes intermittently disappearing (never both eyes at once) eventually when the weakness peaked (it felt hard to identify words at this point, was on phone call) my left eye lost all vision for about 30 seconds. Afterwards the extreme blur stayed for about two hours. Had a big olâ€™ headache behind the left eye about an hour after vision loss. Still do, pulsing, changing in intensity at random.

I canâ€™t afford a copay til weeks end","Neurosurgeon here.We use an unnecessarily fancy term for that: amaurosis fugax which means transient vision loss. It results from the retina not getting enough blood flow for a short period of time (the ophthalmic artery is the first to branch from the internal carotid artery and also has collateral flow from the external carotid in some people) and can be considered a stroke symptom, making it a TIA (transient ischemic attack: basically pre-stroke). Though since you're young, I wouldn't put a stenotic ICA or CCA on the top of my list as the ""sudden, short and quickly recovered loss of vision"" is more commonly a result of your blood pressure being too low for a short period of time. In other words your heart couldn't keep up to your brains oxygen (blood flow) needs for a short while but eventually adjusted, just a little bit late. If the symptom repeats, I would (if I were to see you as a patient in clinic or maybe the ER) refer you to a cardiologist and maybe also consider a brain vessel imaging (a CTA or MRA, whichever is preferred). Considering your history, dehydration may have exacerbated the issue so try to stay hydrated. A syncope event itself is mostly okay as blood flow to the brain is usually immediately recovered but falling down and hitting your head on something like concrete may not."

If this is the case, I can't afford treatment, let alone a doctors visit. Here's  what's been going on though, and apologies for TMI. 3 or maybe 4 months ago, I noticed that I was pooping less frequently. My diets not the best (cheap junk food and bad balance in general), so I'm no stranger to constipation. So it wasn't anything new. When I was pooping though, and still to this day, the smell is this sickening weird death smell that I haven't had before until now, and the same thing for passing gas. No blood though, or any serious stomach pains which I read is a possible symptom of colon cancer. This smell though goes beyond that, and I am constantly smelling it while just passively breathing in. I thought maybe I have some kind of infection somewhere? Besides this though, I've been feeling more tired than normal. I'm an avid coffee drinker so I tried more coffee and that didn't help. No coffee at all, and I felt exactly the same somehow. I'll take a nap and wake up tired. Thought it could be vitamin deficiency but I'm always outside and taking b12s and all that. Idk.

No issues with the pregnancy so far either.This additional ultrasound was performed because my doctor told me this pregnancy is considered a ""geriatric pregnancy"".The technician kept switching the transducer (?) and tried to get the baby to move more to be able to take better pictures. (""The baby is not cooperative"" was what she said.)Baby was moving and normal heartbeat was measured. Technician printed pictures for me and congratulated me on the pregnancy.When my OBGYN called today he told me that unfortunately something seems to be wrong with the baby, and asked if I already heard anything from the technician who did the ultrasound (I told him I did not).He couldn't tell me what medical condition it was, he said that he had never seen this before, the only thing he could tell me was that we need another ultrasound next week to confirm, and that genetic specialists might have to talk to me.He said that there might have been something wrong with the ultrasound machine, but he sounded so negative on the phone that it made me feel like this pregnancy won't be able to continue. When I asked him to be more specific, he mentioned the following- Cavum Septum Pellucidum (CSP) not seen- Nasal Bone absent- Brain is normal size but couldn't see a cerebellumI googled the CSP and found sites that mentioned it would be difficult to locate before 18 weeks.I'm devastated right now and find it difficult being left with this information and having to wait for another week, that's why I'm seeking for advise here.How likely is it that the technician just did a bad job or the ultrasound was not clear enough at 12 weeks, especially considering that so many features seem to be absent on the ultrasound? If the features are absent on the next ultrasound, what genetic disorder does this indicate and should I come to terms with the fact that this pregnancy most likely has to be terminated?Anything experienced something similar before? Ultrasound image https://freeimage.host/i/bdgj2IThank you for your help.Edit: Thank you for all your input so far.I have asked for the report and it was sent to me.These are the things mentioned as abnormal:""Choroid/skull: Abnormal.

Omphalocele likely containing bowel just to the left of the cord insertion. Overall size measures approximately 8mm.

Omphalocele.""","The ultrasound that is performed around 11-13 weeks of pregnancy is very important in order to detect certain abnormalities that can be seen early in pregnancy. The one image you have provided does not help a lot. However, absent nasal septum can be a worrying sign, although not always indicative of an actual problem with the fetus since it can be seen later in pregnancy. I have seen mothers with small noses have fetuses that looked like that on ultrasound but were born completely normal. Regarding the brain abnormalities, some cannot be seen clearly so early in pregnancy and some can be corrected later on. If absence of cerebellum is confirmed however, it can turn out to be a very serious condition for the newborn and can lead to severe developmental delay and neurological problems later in life. You should for sure have another ultrasound by a specialist in that field. You might need also further testing, e.g. amniocentesis to confirm. I don't want to sound extremely alarming but you should also think about the possibility of terminating such a pregnancy if severe abnormalities are confirmed. Excuse the maybe not so great use of the language but English is not my native language.

[23F, Hispanic, 131 lbs, recently diagnosed with vertigo, Vasovagal syncope, and possibly POTS Syndrome, primary issue has happened over the course of the past week or so]So, Iâ€™m feeling very overwhelmed here. Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed with epilepsy. Iâ€™ve had doctors toss around the idea of â€œabsence seizuresâ€ù when I would have spells of zoning out over the past few years. I also used to faint randomly. That stopped for a few years. Fast forward to this week, Iâ€™m having issues again; but worse-Monday: I went to the ER because Iâ€™ve been getting some messed up vertigo symptoms. I felt very off. They told me the vertigo was related to my bp &amp; hr dropping and going up upon position changes (think they mentioned POTS?)Tuesday night: I pass out at home after feeling light headed for a while. This time (unlike times in previous years) I am out, unconscious on the floor. When I wake up I get told my eyes were fluttering and I wasnâ€™t responding. I was out maybe 3 minutes. I still had trouble speaking after waking up.Wednesday morning: I got to work, my head was killing me in one specific spot in the back of my head for a few hours. Pain started to get intense, started getting heart palpitations, light headed was returns- BOOM, hit the ground - unconscious yet again. One of my co-workers found me, I wasnâ€™t responding and I was randomly twitching. My eyes were open but fluttering again. He called an ambulance and once the medics got there (literally within 2 minutes) they tried to wake me up but I wasnâ€™t responding still. I was in and out by this point but I couldnâ€™t speak or move. I heard him say my eyes were all over the place, next thing I knew he was digging his knuckles into my sternum and that mostly got me conscious again. When I opened my eyes I was dead confused and felt like I was about to slip out again. They brought me to the hospital and the doctor was ready to chalk it up to a migraine until it happened again while she was right next to me. Then she decided I needed to be seen by neurology and I was admitted. While I waited a few hours for neurology, the nurses noticed my eyes, tried to wake me up but I was again unable to speak or move. More knuckles into my sternum.They got a rush order for an EEG (still took a few hours to get) but they only did it for about 35 mins and that was with breaks because I had to keep using the bathroom. Once the test was done and read- they said it came back normal and that it was not seizures. I was told it was Vasovagal syncope + vertigo and potentially POTS Syndrome. Friday: took day off from work to rest as I felt off still. Today at work: started to get odd sensation in back of my head like a tickle or skin crawling feeling almost that moved into back of my neck. Started to feel a bit of twitchiness. Feeling got more intense in my head and I felt myself checking out again. My co worker made sure I was safe and tried to wake me up. He said my eyes again were all over the place and fluttery, and this time I was super twitchy. He had to give me a few minutes after I was awake again because I still couldnâ€™t speak right after.  I just got a notification that the EEG report posted to my portal so I looked at it (even though I am aware I was told it was normal). I read it, it says â€œNo epileptiform abnormalities are appreciatedâ€ù(I.e-normal), but in the beginning of the report itâ€™s says â€œsubsequently witnessed to have episode of R head turn and unresponsiveness c/f seizure.â€ù I know Iâ€™m not a doctor, I have no clue about any of this, but I feel like I need medication.

I have a child to chase around and need to get better.","These are atypical symptoms and while I've learned anything can be seizure it can also be other things.- I'd try my best to keep hydrated, alongside a high salt diet for now to see whether that gets you feeling better. If this helps, would be suggestive of POTS or vasovagal spells (you can youtube ""the fainting lark"" for examples of passing out that look like seizures).- agree with not driving for now just in case, as you seem exhausted regardless, even if these aren't seizures- consider requesting an ambulatory eeg via a neurologist or your doc. You'd essentially just wear an eeg for several days, and since you have these spells frequently, are likely to get an answer - empiric seizure med could also be tried. Depends on the doc and their comfort level with trying something but something like topiramate could help both prevent migraines and seizures."

N111,"21M | 170cm | 67kg | Non-smoker | Alcohol once a month or less | GERD, anxiety |Hey! For 2-3 years now i have had a very low pulse imo. In the beginnig of this i didnt eat much and i went from 86kg down to 55kg, because of health anxiety. Im much better now. Im not super athletic at all, i only go for 1-2 walks a day for 1 hour +. I dont work atm and im usually at home. Last BP was 130/66. I had 2 ECGs in july, they were good. So, i can have a full blown panick attack and my pulse will still be like 46-60 and i breathe very slow, feels like i cant ""normally"" breathe faster. My pulse increases when i stand and when i walk etc and ive had like 166 when walking up a hill, i never get tired, and i walk fast. Peak Flow Meter is 500-600 and my Spo2 is always 97-99%. The problem is that it just feels so weak and slow when im wide awake and have panick attacks, shouldnt it go up when im like that, and hyperventilate? Im the complete opposite. My doc told me its alright, i have been there several times, and my heart and lungs sounds fine. She told me that i had no need to go to a cardiologist unless i started passing out occasionally etc. Why is it like this? Am i just in better shape then i think? The anxiety one is just weird for me. I have GERD and alot of muscle tension throughout my body. Im usually not dizzy when i have low pulse, i feel alright, just scared and anxious about it. Been hard to breathe these 3 years but always normal Spo2. Dont know what more info could be relevant.","Young, relatively healthy people commonly have low resting heart rates. Your heart is just more ""efficient"" when it's younger and not abused from decades of high blood pressure. So I wouldn't continue worrying about your heart right now. I do encourage you to focus that anxiety, though. Panic attacks suck and I wish you all the best."

So I was hospitalized two weeks ago for sudden and first time PSVT post COVID â€” had a complete cardiac work up and 2 day admission to tele which showed no further arrhythmia. Echo was normal EJ 55-60%. I was sent back to ER yesterday after a couple days of leg pain and being winded, doc wanted to rule out clots after bed rest. They did an ultrasound on leg which was normal, and a D Dimer with results of &lt;150 ng/mL. Troponin draw was 0.000 (on admission 2 weeks ago it was 0.051 after the arrhythmia which was sustained 15 mins prior to self resolution, after ice water on my face). Told this all but rules out any clots, but donâ€™t understand the way it is expressed in numbers?What does this value of D Dimer mean ? Is this negative or should it say 0.000 as the Troponin ? I am seeing an EP Cardiologist soon for possible further tests and Holter as well.Thank you kindly in advance !","D-dimer is a byproduct of clot formation, so anytime a clot forms some d-dimer will form as well. The bigger the clot the more the d-dimer. Naturally the body is constantly forming clots from microtrauma to blood vessels due to normal wear and tear. But also after getting an injury, like blood drawn for lab work. Ultimately that means that you will always have some d-dimer amount in your blood. Which is what makes it a horrible test in most applications, very sensitive to almost anything and very not specific to almost anything.Troponin is a protein that is part of muscle, in your case they were looking for cardiac troponin (from the heart). It is only supposed to be in the heart muscle cells. If any of it is in the blood that means there was heart muscle breakdown and the troponin ""leaked"" into the blood from within the muscle cells of the heart. The more heart muscle damage, the higher the troponin level. So ideally you should have none in your blood.This is an oversimplification but the gist of it."

He told me again and again he felt nothing in my testicles and that I shouldn't be worried at all. After I agreed but just put forward the idea that maybe I could just make sure everything was fine he suggested that it could be a varicose vein, told me to get a scan of the area and sent me on my way. No more questions. All throughout just a really arrogant and overly sure of himself tone.I mea, am I wrong for feeling frustrated here?

N115,"Secretion/saliva in disabled childHello, my son (6) has a rare genetic/peroxisomal disorder and is completely dependent on us for everything. He has no head control and is very much like a baby in terms of his activity and self care.  He has a GTube for feeding and receives nothing by mouth due to aspirating everything.  He constantly battles excess saliva.  A scope showed a constant stream of bubbly saliva all the way down his throat.  His tonsils are not large and all looks well functionally but itâ€™s just a steady stream of bubbles.  We are constantly wiping his face and at night he coughs/gags and we use a suction machine with a little sucker attached to clear out his mouth and nose.  He previously was on Robinol to help halt the secretions but he had bad side effects and we stopped.  His ENT recommended a cough assist machine which we use but feel like it does nothing.  Another option we had discussed was Botox but weâ€™re told there are some serious side effects with that as well.  We are looking for recommendations or advice on alternative treatments",Botox is reasonable to trial to see if it would be helpful in reducing the symptoms. A more last resort option would be to remove a number of the major salivary glands to reduce saliva production. This would obviously be a decently extensive surgery which I'd argue has more side effects than botox.

I saw an ENT in Nov 2021 who felt a lump on the right side of my neck and had a CT done. My complaints and reason for seeing the ENT included headaches, neck pain, very visible asymmetrical swelling on my right neck/jawline, mild swallowing difficulties/chronic cough (Iâ€™ve had a cough since 2019). These were the findings:2021 FINDINGS: No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the right parotid gland. No definite evidence of disproportionate enhancement, radiopaque calculi or ductal dilatation to the parotid gland on the right. Submandibular glands, muscles of mastication, tongue, floor of mouth, pharynx, larynx appear unremarkable. No definite enlarged lymph nodes within the neck. Few phleboliths noted within the palatine tonsils. Asymmetry in the size of the thyroid glands with the right appearing larger than the left. No definite CT evidence of a discrete nodule within the thyroid. Streak artifact coursing through the thyroid from the patient shoulders. Nasal septum deviated to the right with a prominent spur abutting the inferior turbinate. Paranasal sinuses appear unopacified. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity incompletely seen on this study. Partial opacification of the remaining inferior mastoid air cells. Prominent degenerative changes within the cervical spine most pronounced at C5-C6 and C6-C7. Mild to moderate neural foramina narrowing on the right  at C5-C6.IMPRESSION:1. No definite CT evidence of a discrete mass within the parotid gland.2. Mild nonspecific enlargement of the thyroid on the right relative to the left.3. Partial mastoidectomy changes noted on the right with a metallic device extending into the middle ear cavity._____________My ENT wrote â€œno discreet mass was noted.

An audiologist fixes that by changing the electrode stimulations such that it doesn't do that. If there are zaps or other concerning things, an audiologist can interrogate it to determine what is going on. You may be perceiving facial stimulation as zaps. Either way, this wouldn't have anything to do with what you are experiencing in the neck. I don't know what's going on in the neck, the CT was unremarkable and your physician didn't seem to find anything that was concerning.

In countries where malaria is common, the doctors are usually also experienced with treatment. Obviously it depends on where exactly you are, and if youâ€™re in a very rural area, you might be out of luck.If you can use your tablets to keep up the proper prophylactic dose until 1 1/2 weeks before returning, that might be a good option, because as far as I know the incubation period for malaria usually is around two weeks, so if you return and start feeling sick, you can get proper treatment at home. If you are staying for a longer time, I would really recommend trying to find medication on location to replace what you gave away. Otherwise keeping the emergency dose is probably not a bad idea. Thereâ€™s always concerns about fake meds unfortunately, but in areas where Malaria is common, you should be possible to get the meds at a pharmacy.You seem to be doing well with the whole preventative measures like mosquito netting, behavioural choices etc., so keep that up. Not getting stung/bitten is the best protection, and if you have spent some time down there, you probably have minimising exposure down well.I might not be on top of my malaria game, so if someone else could chime in, that be great.

N168,"Hi all!My wife (34F) suffers from chronic pain and has many of the symptoms of migraine or cluster headache: mainly on one side, face pain around the sinuses and jaw, photophobia, pain at the base of the neck.She also has other long standing pain issues in her shoulder, shoulder blade, and down to her mid back on the same side. Not looking for a diagnosis but I canâ€™t seem to understand how almost all of her ailments are so much better on 50mg sumatriptan (prescribed by doctor). The headache and face pain makes sense, as does the photophobia , but the sumatriptan also seems to help with neck, shoulder and general upper back pain. Her overall mood seems better (no doubt because sheâ€™s in less pain). Itâ€™s almost a miracle - on days with no sumatriptan sheâ€™s bed-bound, but on days where she takes it, she can almost live a life again. Could her shoulder, neck and upper/mid back pain be related to migraine/cluster headaches? So by helping with the origin of the pain, the sumatriptan helps with other areas? Also, am I correct in understanding that sumatriptan specifically works on migraine/cluster headaches and nothing else? Thanks, trying to make sense of why this works while also struggling to get GP appointments that arenâ€™t weeks away.","She should ask about a CGRP antagonist like Emgality if sheâ€™s needing to use sumatriptan this frequently. Many get migraines from cranial nerve dysfunction, most notably the trigeminal nerve which can cause all sorts of funky, very painful sensations to occur. Triptans do work well for migraines and act at the level of the blood vessels in the brain stop them from spasming. Newer drugs like CGRP antagonists actually help to calm the nerves that are inflamed. She might benefit from this if she is having so many extra cranial nerve issues as well. Some with migraines get more widespread symptoms, which can even affect the GI tract. If triptans work this well for her functionality, itâ€™s time to find something preventative, not just abortive meaning chasing symptoms instead of preventing them."

I'm sorry you're going through this, must be difficult.&amp;#x200B;Could it be coarctation of the aorta? Maybe. I can't know without examining you thoroughly and without an ankle brachial index (BP comparison between ankle and bicep.) You would also need an echocardiogram to confirm it.&amp;#x200B;Let me answer the other question about the life expectancy. There is something you need to understand about life expectancy: It is a statistical figure.YOU are not a statistic. You are a real person with a real body that may or may not be similar to others. Not only that, but also the statistic you are pulling is for those who NEVER get treated. I don't like to tell patients their chances of survival or death based on averages. I prefer to tailor the discussion to the patient. From what you've said so far, it seems you have been mostly asymptomatic. The cause of morbidity and death for patients with this disease is development of hypertension, kidney disease, coronary artery disease, stroke, aortic dissection, and heart failure. From what you've said so far, I can say you most likely have not developed any of those complications, however some lab tests and imaging need to be done to check for sure. Your condition can still be salvaged and your life expectancy prolonged. Yes I believe you do have ""optimistic"" chances.IF it is coarctation of the aorta, you will need more lab tests and imaging and you will be managed accordingly. I assure you though, you will not drop dead suddenly just because you have coarctation of the aorta, it usually leads to complications which you will definitely notice. Try not to think too much about it, once you have confirmation of diagnosis, then work up can start and management can proceed."

This doesnâ€™t happen all the time as Iâ€™m purposely taking deep breaths that triggers my heart to beat faster. I also need to mention that my heart has been listened to a few times by many doctors, and they have told me itâ€™s no heart murmur and it sounds normal, and two EKG thatâ€™s normal, but I swear to God these EKG were taken in less than a minute, which was weird, and also one doctor told me I had some physiological arrhythmia but that could maybe be sinus arrhythmia? Can someone help me or am I just dying and Iâ€™ll die soon?Update for more information: I donâ€™t take medication for anything, and I suffer from anxiety but this doesnâ€™t feel like anxiety at all, this felt like I was suffocating and blacking out while already lying down.","&gt;A few years ago I noticed when breathing in, my heart beats faster, when exhaling it beats slowerThis is called sinus arrythmia and is normal, and in fact healthy in young people"

N202,"I'm a mom of 4 kids (ages 12, 11, 6, and 4). They're all fully vaccinated and always up-to-date on regular check-ups. My 6-year-old, who I'll call J, is the only kiddo with any issues, and they've generally been mild. He has moderate asthma which is controlled with Flovent, but has otherwise been a healthy and active kid. But recently, J has been getting sick a LOT. I just picked up his third prescription for antibiotics in 30 days, and he has had a fever for 6 days now that doesn't completely go away even with multiple fever reducers (it does go down enough that he's comfortable though). Yesterday I noticed he has swollen, bleeding gums and a few ulcer-like sores in the back of his throat which the doctor diagnosed as hand, foot, and mouth disease (no tests were done though). Today I brought him back in due to his fever spiking to 104.6 and him struggling to walk/move last night (also improved - but not completely fixed - with meds) and they did a strep test which came back positive.The reason I'm really worried though is the weight loss and his medical record in general. I looked up his growth chart when I got home (I can access his records online) and he has grown 1.3 inches in the last 6 months but his weight dropped by 1 pound, causing his BMI to go from the 20th percentile to the 1st. I also looked at his blood work. They checked his hemoglobin at his 6-year checkup in July and that was low at 10, but they told me to just make sure he's eating iron (he eats a lot of iron-rich foods but doc said to just increase them). The last time he had a CBC was 5 years ago at his 1 year check-up but I looked at it anyway and his lymphocytes were high and neutrophils were low, but I don't think his doctor ever said anything about abnormal results so maybe that's not a concern? I didn't have online access at the time so I'm sure when they didn't call with results, I assumed they were normal.Should I have the doctor do a CBC if he keeps getting infections or not gaining weight/losing weight? Or should the doctor tell me if these things are concerning? I feel like a hypochondriac but I really just have a feeling something isn't right. :(","Not likely to be something to stress over.Though it varies by your community/exposure risks, I have seen multiple cases between the hospital and clinic this last month with multiple viruses, back to back viruses, etc. It is not unreasonable that he was sick multiple times.The fever is likely from whatever viral processes he had going on.  Outside of strep nothing sounds bacterial from what youâ€™ve mentioned so I think 3 rounds of antibiotics was more appeasement or risk stratification than â€œappropriateâ€ù treatment.  Without a known or suspected bacterial nidus, no reason for antibiotics.He could have poorer dental hygiene with being sick, inflammation from infection, or it could be something like a vitamin C deficiency with the bleeding gums and recurrent infections.  Load him up with some emergenC.Weight loss is normal when being sick and I wouldnâ€™t even look at his weight again until heâ€™s been healthy for around 4-6 weeks with normal appetite.HFM is a clinical diagnosis, I wouldnâ€™t send you to get the $800+ PCR test to confirm it in just about any case, since the management wouldnâ€™t change.His CBC 5 years ago is has virtually no relevance to his current state unless there was a pathological anomaly like leukemia found on the initial one.  I wouldnâ€™t even concern myself with mild anemia in 1-2 year olds at that level due to increased milk consumption and the body still ramping up production while growing rapidly.At the end of the day nothing here is concerning for him being sick beyond seasonal illness but you should speak to your pediatrician about it in more detail so you feel comfortable that youâ€™ve covered your bases if youâ€™re truly still worried."
N204,"45 F. 5'7"", 220 lbs, former smoker. Drink occasionally. Nothing recreational. Meds: omeprazole daily, famotidine prn, cetirizine daily. I had an abdominal/pelvic CT today for months long issue of epigastric pain radiating to the back. Endoscopy was normal, symptoms not relieved by PPIs or H2 blockers, hence the CT.My question is regarding an incidental finding on the CT that the GI office did not bring up when they called me to discuss results. I only saw the complete report after getting off the phone.There was nothing on the CT that could explain my GI symptoms, but under the ""Findings"" section for lower chest ""mild scarring/atelectasis"" is listed. No other description is given. However, these findings are left out of the ""Impressions"" section of the report. As I said, I'm a former smoker. I have also had pneumonia at least 3 times in my life with a bout back in April. I didn't have a chest x-ray until May, a couple of weeks later, and that read ""Impression: Peribronchial thickening consistent with bronchiolitis and/or reactive airway disease"". No one called me to discuss those particular results and I had mostly recovered from the pneumonia (I thought) so I just shrugged it off. Turns out that since that bout of pneumonia, I have a harder time catching my breath than I used to and it's even a bit painful sometimes depending on the level of strain.The CT report is verbatim as follows:  ""Lower chest: mild scarring/atelectasis"" Can someone explain to me what this actually might mean for me clinically? Google U just screams ""COLLAPSED LUNG"" at me and that is not helpful. Is this something I need to be concerned about? What could be the cause? Can it be related to the findings on that x-ray? Should I get a pulmonology consult?I should add that I am changing insurance plans for the 2nd time in one year and the town I live in has a provider shortage and most of them are only accepting new OB patients. It has been difficult getting care because of this.Thanks for the input.","Atelectasis isnâ€™t an uncommon finding. It just means your lung in that area is not being inflated. It is indeed collapsed. This can be for any number of reason but for most it is due to lack of exercise or activity. Itâ€™s also common in those with recurrent infections or get bronchitis because gunk builds up and blocks airways from getting proper aeration. Typically when you work your body, you tend to breath in harder which opens up all portions of your lungs. Your lungs are made up of tons of tiny little balloons (alveoli). The balloons at the bottom of your lung sometimes need extra force to really open them up. In your case, if you have scarring in that area, it may be even harder to inflate. Atelectasis is when the balloons collapse and havenâ€™t been opened up in some time. It looks like your lung tissue has shrunken but typically isnâ€™t a problem unless a large portion of your lung is affected. If youâ€™ve never tried one, a spirometer might be beneficial to help open up this portion of your lung. Guaifenesin to clear out mucus may also help. It can also be painful to open that portion of the lung up if atelectasis has been long standing."

There are two that connect to the bones of hearing (stapedius and tensor tympani) which can have intermittent spasms and give an interesting sound that may e what you are describing.

N209,"{23, Male ; from Belgium}&amp;#x200B;Hi Everyone !I hope you are well. As far as I am concerned, I am not fine :/. Indeed, I have had pain in my wrist for almost a year now. The pain appeared after a game of bowling (I don't remember exactly how I got hurt because at the time I didn't feel any pain). At first I thought it was tendonitis, so I rested my wrist, but nothing helped: the pain persisted.The pain is on the radial side of the wrist. To be precise, I would say that the pain is located in the synovial sheath at the level of the radial extensors. The pain is quite diffuse (from the extensor pollicis longus to the abductor pollicis longus), so it is complicated to determine a precise location of the pain.The pain is always present to an acceptable degree but it intensifies when I pronate or flex my wrist, for example. Tennis is typically the kind of sport I can't do anymore because the pain is too intense.A few months ago I had an MRI scan but the radiologists didn't see anything abnormal. I think they must have looked wrong because when I did an ultrasound scan a few weeks later, they told me I had inflammation of the sheath and that an infiltration would solve the problem. The problem is that the cortisone infiltration (done on the radial extensors) that I did, didn't work. So now, I don't know who to believe and I don't know the cause of my pain. I think that maybe the problem is related to the nerves (radial or medial) and not to the tendons  but that's just a guess.Is there anyone here who could look at my MRI (I'll send you a video) because I'm sure they didn't look properly...&amp;#x200B;Cheers !","Sure sounds like tendonitis. Nerve pain in that area would generally not be exacerbated by moving the wrist, though pain with pronation could potentially point to nerve entrapment at the elbow.

Typically for tendinitis - or pain at the radial wrist for a variety of reasons - a [thumb spica splint](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B5Q3LBLJ?pd_rd_i=B0B5Q3LBLJ&amp;pf_rd_p=8df9856b-9cff-4e77-9cb1-dc4719b9c19d&amp;pf_rd_r=4MEXZW2FR80E7K1KXMRS&amp;pd_rd_wg=kSfKc&amp;pd_rd_w=WN1Ye&amp;pd_rd_r=0545045d-c9b5-4f0f-bc46-c0ca0633e140) and hand therapy will do the trick, and we only reach for cortisone injections if you've tried those and failed."
